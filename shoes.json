It\u2019s now snappy, better fitting, and more fun\u2014it's just a better shoe overall. Underneath, however, is still that unmistakably Clifton feel that we know and love.

Yet despite its familiar looks, we discovered a full overhaul under the hood. Hoka raised the stack to maximalist levels, widened the toebox, and increased the drop to favor heel strikers. There are downsides too, as the weight gain, outdated foam, and flatter ride make it less lively than before. Still, for comfort-seekers chasing a stable, everyday option, it remains a solid pick that\u2019s likely to sell fast once again.

    "verdict": "In our lab tests, the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v13 emerged as the top contender for those who prioritize supreme softness in a daily trainer. It's not only the most cushioned 1080 yet, but also one of the plushiest running shoes we've ever experienced. The top-notch upper and impressive durability also set a high bar that rivals will struggle to reach. However, we found the Fresh Foam X midsole falls short in energy return, a letdown for those seeking more bounce. Yet, at $165, we believe it's reasonably priced given its blend of distinctive attributes and performance. Top pick in best New Balance running shoes (2024)",

In our view, ASICS aimed to address the weaker points of v3 and largely succeeded, although the shoe did gain some weight and lose a bit of its original magic in the process. Despite this, it's a fantastic all-rounder we think it's poised to be one of the top running shoes for a second consecutive year.

From its eucalyptus-based upper to the BioPebax midsole derived from castor beans and the heavy use of recycled materials, we can't help but love all the environmentally responsible features  crammed into this shoe. What's more, we were pleasantly surprised with just how nicely it rides during our less intense daily runs. While its hefty weight and even heftier price tag are a little prohibitive, we think it is worth it to support a brand dedicated to reducing the carbon footprint of their shoes and look forward to further improvements coming in the future!",

We were excited to see it maintain its commitment to a grounded feel, offering stability and agility on various surfaces and inclines. However, we noticed in our lab tests that it sheds the optional StoneGuard insert found in its predecessors. We also found it slightly heavy for its stack height and the ride might be too firm for some. Yet, it stands out as a great choice for trail enthusiasts wanting a natural running experience without breaking the bank. Top pick in best Altra trail running shoes",

We loved all of these in the Kailas Fuga YAO, which we also think is a hidden gem in the sea of trail running shoes . It is very easy to overlook due to the brand's relatively recent appearance on the market. And yet, since you're already here, a long list of the shoe's benefits might end your search for a new high-performance pair right now.",
